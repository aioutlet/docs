## Configuration Summary

### Environment Variables Used

**Node.js Services (auth, admin, user, audit, notification):**

- `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS`: Window size in milliseconds
- `RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS`: Maximum requests per window
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment (development/production) affects limits

**Python Services (inventory, product):**

- `API_RATE_LIMIT_REQUESTS`: Maximum requests per window
- `API_RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW`: Window size in seconds
- `FLASK_ENV`/`ENVIRONMENT`: Environment affects limits

**C# Services (order, payment):**

- `RateLimiting:Enabled`: Enable/disable rate limiting
- `RateLimiting:WindowSizeInMinutes`: Window size in minutes
- `RateLimiting:RequestLimit`: Base request limit

**Java Services (order-processor):**

- `app.rate-limit.enabled`: Enable/disable rate limiting
- `app.rate-limit.requests-per-minute`: General request limit
- `app.rate-limit.saga-operations-per-minute`: Saga-specific limit
- `app.rate-limit.admin-operations-per-minute`: Admin-specific limit

## Security Features

### Common Security Features Across All Services:

1. **IP-based rate limiting** for anonymous users
2. **User-based rate limiting** for authenticated users
3. **Health check exclusions** (no rate limiting for monitoring endpoints)
4. **Comprehensive logging** of rate limit violations
5. **Correlation ID tracking** for rate limit events
6. **Graduated response delays** (where applicable)
7. **Environment-specific limits** (stricter in production)

### Advanced Security Features:

1. **Multi-tier rate limiting** (different limits for different operation types)
2. **Burst handling** with queues (C# services)
3. **Token bucket algorithm** (Java service) for smooth rate limiting
4. **Enhanced security logging** for financial operations (payment service)
5. **Operation-specific partitioning** (read vs write operations)

## Monitoring and Observability

### Rate Limiting Headers (where applicable):

- `X-Rate-Limit-Remaining`: Remaining requests in current window
- `X-Rate-Limit-Limit`: Total limit for current window
- `Retry-After`: Seconds to wait before retry (429 responses)
- `X-Rate-Limit-Exceeded`: Flag indicating rate limit breach

### Logging:

- All rate limit violations are logged with:
  - Client IP address
  - User ID (if authenticated)
  - Request path and method
  - Correlation ID for tracing
  - User agent information
  - Timestamp of violation

## Deployment Considerations

### Redis Dependencies:

- **inventory-service**: Uses Redis for distributed rate limiting storage
- **Other services**: Can use Redis if available, fallback to in-memory storage

### Performance Impact:

- **Minimal overhead**: All implementations use efficient algorithms
- **Memory usage**: In-memory storage for Node.js services, Redis for distributed scenarios
- **Scalability**: User-based partitioning ensures fair resource allocation

### Health Checks:

- All services exclude health check endpoints (`/health`, `/metrics`) from rate limiting
- This ensures monitoring and load balancer health checks are not affected

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor rate limiting effectiveness** through logs and metrics
2. **Adjust limits based on actual usage patterns**
3. **Consider implementing distributed rate limiting** across service instances using Redis
4. **Add alerting** for frequent rate limit violations (potential security incidents)
5. **Implement rate limit bypass** for trusted internal service-to-service communication
6. **Consider implementing dynamic rate limiting** based on system load

## Test Implementation

To test the rate limiting implementation:

1. **Manual Testing**: Use tools like `curl` or Postman to send rapid requests
2. **Load Testing**: Use tools like Apache Bench (`ab`) or Artillery to simulate high load
3. **Integration Testing**: Verify rate limiting doesn't interfere with normal operations
4. **Monitoring**: Check logs for rate limit events and verify proper error responses

Example test command:

```bash
# Test rate limiting with curl
for i in {1..200}; do curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" http://localhost:3000/api/endpoint; done
```

This implementation ensures consistent rate limiting across all microservices while respecting the unique requirements and technology stacks of each service.
